# Simple JS Todo app
This was a assignment for school to show my Javascript knowledge. I was given a list of features and techniques to include in the project which I've successfully included in the application. 

I know using Sass might be a little overkill for such a small project but I felt like practicing and it also makes CSS 100x easier to write and read.
